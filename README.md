# pi-nolo

No-YOLO mode for [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/nichochar/pi-mono). Gates `write`, `edit`, and `bash` tool calls behind user confirmation — press Enter to allow, Escape to block.

Read-safe bash commands (`ls`, `grep`, `git status`, etc.) are auto-approved via a configurable allowlist, so you only get prompted for commands that could mutate state.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@burneikis/pi-nolo
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/burneikis/pi-nolo
```

### Note:

The default YOLO-cycle shortcut is `ctrl+y`, which conflicts with pi's built-in `tui.editor.yank`. Instead of editing pi's `keybindings.json`, you can move the extension's shortcut by setting `"shortcut": "ctrl+shift+y"` in your `nolo.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Changing it takes effect after a `/reload`.

## What it does

Every time the agent tries to:

- **Write a file** — confirms with the file path and line count
- **Edit a file** — confirms with the file path; shows a pre-rendered diff preview before the tool finishes executing
- **Run a bash command** — auto-approves safe read-only commands; confirms everything else

You get a dialog: Enter to allow, Escape to block.

In non-interactive mode (no UI), all mutations are blocked by default.

## Pre-rendered edit diffs

As of pi ~0.63.0, the built-in edit tool only shows diffs after execution. This extension includes a built-in pre-renderer (ported from [pi-pre-render-edit](https://github.com/burneikis/pi-pre-render-edit)) that computes and displays the diff as soon as the tool arguments are complete -- before the edit is applied. This means you can see exactly what will change while the confirmation dialog is open.

If you previously installed `pi-pre-render-edit` separately, you can remove it -- the functionality is now bundled here.

## YOLO modes

Use `/yolo` to cycle through three modes at any time during a session:

| Mode            | Footer label | Write/Edit     | Bash                              |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `off` (default) | `nolo`       | confirm        | confirm (safe cmds auto-approved) |
| `writes`        | `writes`     | **auto-allow** | confirm (safe cmds auto-approved) |
| `full`          | `yolo`       | **auto-allow** | **auto-allow**                    |

Each `/yolo` invocation advances to the next mode and wraps back around:

```
off → writes-yolo → full-yolo → off → …
```

The current mode is shown in the footer status bar. It is also persisted in the session so it survives a `/reload`. You can also set the initial mode at launch with the [`--nolo-mode` CLI flag](#cli-flag--automation).

### When to use each mode

- **`writes`** — you trust the edits but still want a gate on shell commands.
- **`full`** — you want the agent to run completely hands-free. Use with caution.

### CLI flag / automation

For hands-free or non-interactive runs (`pi -p "..."`), cycling modes with `/yolo` isn't possible. Use the `--nolo-mode` flag to start a session directly in a chosen mode:

```bash
pi --nolo-mode full -p "do the thing"
```

The flag accepts `off`, `writes`, or `full` and appears in `pi --help`.

- **Precedence**: when present and valid, the flag always wins — it overrides any mode persisted in the session.
- **Absence**: omitting the flag changes nothing; the default (`off`) or restored session mode is used, exactly as before.
- **Invalid value**: an unrecognized value (e.g. `--nolo-mode turbo`) is ignored — the restored/default mode is kept and a warning is shown in interactive sessions.
- **Restart caveat**: like `shortcut`, the flag is resolved when the extension loads, so it only takes effect on a fresh launch (not on `/reload`). Toggling with `/yolo` after launch still works and overrides the flag's value.

## Bash Command Allowlist

Safe commands are auto-approved without a confirmation dialog. A command is considered safe when:

1. It starts with a recognized safe prefix (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `git status`)
2. It does **not** contain any dangerous patterns (pipes, chaining, redirects, etc.)

### Default safe prefixes

```
ls, cat, head, tail, wc, find, grep, rg, fd, tree,
file, stat, du, df, which, whoami, pwd, echo, date, uname,
env, printenv, git status, git log, git diff, git show,
git branch, git remote, git tag, git rev-parse,
npm list, npm outdated, npm view, node --version,
python --version, cargo --version, rustc --version, go version
```

### Dangerous pattern guard

Even if a command starts with a safe prefix, it will still require confirmation if it contains:

- Pipes (`|`), chaining (`&&`, `||`, `;`)
- Command substitution (`` ` ``, `$()`)
- Redirections (`>`, `>>`)
- Dangerous commands (`rm`, `sudo`, `eval`, `exec`, `source`, `sh`, `bash`)

For example, `ls` is auto-approved but `ls; rm -rf /` will prompt for confirmation.

## Configuration

You can customize the allowlist with a `nolo.json` config file:

- **Project-level:** `.pi/nolo.json` (takes precedence)
- **Global:** `~/.pi/agent/nolo.json`

### Config format

```json
{
  "safePrefixes": ["make build", "docker ps", "kubectl get"],
  "dangerousPatterns": ["\\|", "&&", "\\brm\\b"],
  "shortcut": "ctrl+shift+y"
}
```

### Merge behavior

- **`safePrefixes`** — merged (union of defaults + global + project)
- **`dangerousPatterns`** — overridden (project overrides global overrides defaults)
- **`shortcut`** — overridden (project overrides global overrides default)

If no config files exist, the hardcoded defaults are used. See [`nolo.example.json`](nolo.example.json) for the full default configuration.

### Example: add custom safe commands

Create `.pi/nolo.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "safePrefixes": ["make build", "docker ps", "kubectl get pods"]
}
```

These will be added to the defaults — you don't need to re-list the built-in prefixes.

### Example: relax dangerous patterns

If you want to allow piped commands (at your own risk):

```json
{
  "dangerousPatterns": [
    "&&",
    "\\|\\|",
    ";",
    "`",
    "\\$\\(",
    ">\\s",
    ">>",
    "\\brm\\b",
    "\\bsudo\\b",
    "\\beval\\b",
    "\\bexec\\b"
  ]
}
```

This replaces the defaults entirely, so the `\\|` (pipe) pattern is no longer checked.

### Example: change the YOLO-cycle shortcut

The `shortcut` field sets the key that cycles YOLO mode. It defaults to
`ctrl+y`, which collides with pi's built-in `tui.editor.yank`. To avoid
the conflict without touching pi's `keybindings.json`, pick another key:

```json
{
  "shortcut": "ctrl+shift+y"
}
```

The shortcut is resolved once when the extension loads, so changes take
effect after a `/reload`. The `/yolo` slash command always works
regardless of the configured shortcut.
